# Reward-based training of RNNs

## INFO

*Forked from song's repo*

* Add T.Yang's Task paradigm (2007) to this repo.
* Transplant some of the code (task and training) to some other project in neuroscience.


## Requirements

This code is written in Python 2.7 and requires

* [Theano 0.8.2](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/)

## Notes

* For the paper, we used a time step of 10 ms, which results in hundreds of time steps for typical tasks. When training a new task, we highly recommend that you start with a larger value to save time.
